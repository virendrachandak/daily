# Download Stack

Welcome to OS X Mavericks.

The Dock in Mavericks includes Stacks, which you can use to quickly access frequently used files and applications.

Stacks are simple to create. Just drag any folder to the right side of the Dock and it becomes a stack. Click a stack and it springs from the Dock in either a fan or a grid. To open a file in a stack, click the file once.

OS X Mavericks includes a premade stack called Downloads. You opened this file from the Downloads stack. The Downloads stack captures all of your Internet downloads and puts them in one convenient location. Files you download in Safari, Mail, and Message, or share using AirDrop, go right into the Downloads stack. When a file finishes downloading, the stack notifies you by bouncing and put s the new file on top so it's easy to find.

Stacks automatically display their contents in a fan or a grid abased on the number of items in the stack. You can also view the stack as a list. If you prefer one style over the other, you can set the stack to always open in that style.

Stacks show the most relevant items first. If you prefer, you can set the sort order so the items you care about most always appear at the top of the stack. To customize a stck, press the Control key and click the stack's icon. Choose the settings you want from the menu.

To remove a file from a stck, just open the stack and drag the item to another location. To delete a file, move it to the Trash. In fact, when you're done reading this document, feel free to throw it out.
