eclipse the ide egit shipped default version control system for java distributions
visual studio right click checkout functionality
this model social coding
fork and pull model
participating in a project already exited
doing it as you wish
when you offer those changes back in
nullify 
blessed repo
have anybody great line to pass those to some one to do the code review
no body have to be granted the privilege
what i mean by this
any employee
offer to them the trusted
delivery open source any blue icon to the core project maintainers
jvm 5 times the statistical amazing contribution
show web-based image diff
lightweight
incredible thing
look at the other branch
called feature image
condition to think of command line
graphical users no desktop uses
to review the most recent differences
to review the changes to graphicals as well
with png, bmp, gif
zero plugin
zero plugin tools
perhaps the design are contributing
run different engines
trademark emphasize with zero tools on your desktop
pure desktop veiw
burdened with be a productive that's desktop too
lightweight issue tracking
github:enterprise
excited to contribute to open source
that's no the case at all
denied many medical institutions inside their firewall
potentially
sure, of course
privilege
read-only access
what do i do
authorize credential
up-side down
begin helping
later ask the code for your code to be pulled in
as a student in this global repository
getting a full photo copy to my personal accout
rude oh my godness
none of the value is never to go back to the center repository
grab this address return to the command prompt
wearing my githubstudent hat
type git clone and supply this address
change over to helloworld
ask question through git status
brought to my disk
git branch -a
brought over feature
working in progress to my local machine
i'm referring to local instruction
start a new branch
git branch novclassfeature
desciptive name
toggling the branch
the entire local repository to repsent
there is zero difference
nothing what so ever dfferent from these two
open another finder window
get in my way to the same 
ask me why would like to show this
put it on to your screen
when i create a new file
reduce the noise on the background
nice reduction
over to the file style
everything else shrink
take a text editor and create a brand new file
put in a little html code here
see the other files that get participating
put it into version control
same instructions that 
purely local
git commit -m ' A new Branch '
it's not yet on the network
recall the world i said we are allowd
deciding to publish 
opt in
git push -u origin branchname
publish upon github
create branches for just about all small thing
not to long
then to continue
be able to have some code review
git checkout master
please look at the finder view
that file disappear from the file system
get the mental picture
it is updating the filesystem
reverting them to the 
all of the files become update to date
equally checkout that november branch
control contains all the branches
bring back a new branch that is one commit ahead of everything done in the repository
the mose recent change amazing to the central project maintainer
pull request
github side thing, special protocol other than very handsome ui
branches and mergin
offering my student change in fact see the 
for the suggestive change
pull request
why is this a pull request
the permission's model
to contribute to the project
changes are not folded to the main 
decides to bring them in
why they should be brought in
add sparkles
write a little bit description to core maintainer
which units of work I am offering
suggesting the pull
for the core 
remmember top corner
i've already 
100% pull request
transformative
to your own closed source
you know should we give access to
stop having that discussion
give everyone to issue pull request
review and discuss
have a nice little git
reject, approve them
analog debate
argue to this write box
appreciate that a little things from accepting
happy to accept
return to the command line
open that  insert that little additional change requested by the
git commit -m'polish' would be good enough
push those changes back up
what you see
not even code contribution
this means
previewable collaborative
product analog very close
not quite
with that polish merge those changes in
you're not just heading to the right direction
we're no going to repint the sorry
close comment on this
analog with a yes or no
that is a way
you see awful lot of demonstration
the nouns and verbs transition
push doing clone click the clone button
you know the answer now
window.github.com
windows 7
do a quick look
beneath my repositories
let's say a hello git world
privileged access to
brings 
save in exactly the same compatible format
source of delight not a problem
within a week or two
a month or later
to sqush them to 
absolutely unravel
thank you once again
jessica training work
watch one of my videos
git can be hard to learn
concentrate easy for you to use
might take favorite so click on youtube training video
looking forwar to teaching
perfect nothing to rearrage
fork need something to change
nothing stand in my way
merge

github guides

a meaningful discussion of the value of Git begins with a solid
relate to your job describing the might go through 
person with documents in the realm a developer or someone who writes things, write content subsequently correction requet for modification
this things like represent that again and again save the thing again
when you did it, why you did it
open for review at any time in the future
drew a picture
history tracking whey you change recored what that changes were
background logo to the top of the web page for a single indivisual
relative straight forward
in terms of a graphical interface
trying to do the same thing
when you do that 
something much more capable
keep track of who changed it
the capability to unify these all together
interleaving similar adjacent control system like that of git
show here in the same graphical interface
the tool handling it with relative
unification of the two merge bring back to a unified and good recap what brings
to the table
Git is fast and modern
provides a history of content changes
give the history of all
designs in many cases some programming code
facilities actually bring the together simultaneaously
working in lastly approachable any type of knowledge worker
pleasant experience
single click and double click navigation
we are on the web
local on my locato
inter connection
eventually give the under version control
tooling commandline different operating system
have their own bound with command line tools
make historical revolution whether gui or command line
persisted add remote saving 
what about getting it to some working remote
even your creating a different 
git remote add origin https://github.com/githubstudent
getting information from and sending information to
cat .git/config
[remote 'origin']
version pool
account git installed account three tools auto updated
git-scm.com
sufficient daily
